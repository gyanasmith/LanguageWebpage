    <p>User Experience (UX) Designers focus on the overall feel of a product. They make sure that the product is user friendly, makes sense, and provides a good experience when the user is using it.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of things that a UX Designer focuses on, including:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Empathize</strong>: Research and see what users need the most</li>
            <li><strong>Define</strong>: Define what will work best and what won't be important</li>
            <li><strong>Ideate</strong>: Layout of a visual design</li>
            <li><strong>Prototype</strong>: Create a mockup</li>
            <li><strong>Test</strong>: Let people use it and see if its user friendly.</li>
        </ul>
